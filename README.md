# ForkTest
A repository to check (prove :-p) if  changes in a repository are reflected in it's fork.

This is some content that's present in the original repository before forking (i.e, this will appear in the fork).

This is some content that's added after the repository has been forked (i.e, this won't appear in the fork).
